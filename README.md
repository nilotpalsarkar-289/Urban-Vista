## 🌟 Features

### 1️⃣ Backend (ML Model Deployment)  
- Fetches live traffic data, predicts congestion, optimizes routes, and serves results to the frontend.
- **Frameworks:** Flask, REST API, Django  
- **ML Deployment:** TensorFlow Serving, Flask API, AWS Lambda  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB/Firebase  

### 2️⃣ Frontend (User Interaction)  
- Interactive UI for real-time traffic display, route optimization, and congestion analysis.
- **Tech Stack:** React.js, Angular, or Vue.js  
- **Map Integration:** Google Maps API, Leaflet.js  
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSockets, Firebase Realtime Database  

### 3️⃣ Traffic Guidelines & Helpline  
- Provides essential traffic rules and emergency helpline numbers for assistance.

### 4️⃣ Traffic Anomaly Detection  
- Uses ML to predict accident severity based on reports, weather conditions, and infrastructure.
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Trees  

### 5️⃣ License Plate Recognition  
- Detects vehicle number plates using a Flask-based web app with SSD-based TensorFlow model.
- **OCR Engine:** EasyOCR for text extraction  
- **Supported Formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG (Recommended size: 800x600)  
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, Python, Flask  

### 6️⃣ Smart Route Optimization  
- Provides the shortest path between two locations using ML models.
- **Models Used:** GRU, XGBoost, LSTM, SVM
